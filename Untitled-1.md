 # Ethers.js

Ethers.js is a complete, compact, and easy-to-use library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and its ecosystem. It is written in TypeScript and is compatible with both Node.js and browsers.

## Installation

To install Ethers.js, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install ethers
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Once you have installed Ethers.js, you can start using it by importing the library into your project. In Node.js, you can do this by adding the following line to the top of your script:

```javascript
const ethers = require('ethers');
```

In a browser, you can add the following script tag to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/ethers@6.11.0/dist/ethers.min.js"></script>
```

Once you have imported the library, you can start creating instances of the `ethers.Wallet` class. A wallet represents a private key that can be used to sign transactions and interact with the blockchain. To create a new wallet, you can use the `ethers.Wallet.createRandom()` method:

```javascript
const wallet = ethers.Wallet.createRandom();
```

You can also create a wallet from a private key using the `ethers.Wallet.fromPrivateKey()` method:

```javascript
const privateKey = '0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef';
const wallet = ethers.Wallet.fromPrivateKey(privateKey);
```

### Connecting to a Provider

In order to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, you need to connect to a provider. A provider is a service that provides access to the blockchain, such as a full node or an Infura endpoint.

To connect to a provider, you can use the `ethers.providers.getDefaultProvider()` method. This method will automatically connect to the most suitable provider based on your environment.

```javascript
const provider = ethers.providers.getDefaultProvider();
```

You can also specify a specific provider by passing its URL to the `ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider()` constructor. For example, to connect to an Infura endpoint, you would use the following code:

```javascript
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('
